# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

## About this project

In this assignment I have tried to refactor an existing code base. I have attempted to address the following issues to improve the quality of the code:
1. The webpage now has a descriptive title.
2. HTML has been updated to include semantic elements and conforms to accessibility standards.
3. The elements follow a logical structure.
4. CSS has been updated by grouping multiple selectors that apply the same style settings.
5. Added comments in HTML and CSS where appropriate.
6. Made sure all the links are working as they should.
7. The updated web application's appearance and functionality adhere to the design of the mock-up page.


Screen shots:

2. ![Links working.](./Assets/WorkingLinks.png)
3. ![Entire page.](./Assets/EntirePage.png)


## Mock-Up

The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:

![The Horiseon webpage includes a navigation bar, a header image, and cards with text and images at the bottom of the page.](./Assets/01-html-css-git-homework-demo.png)

> **Note**: This layout is designed for desktop viewing, so you may notice that some of the elements don't look like the mock-up at a resolution smaller than 768px. Eventually you'll learn how to make elements responsive so that your web application is optimized for any screen size.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to create your project and deploy it to GitHub Pages:

1. Create a new repository on your GitHub account and clone it to your computer.

2. When you're ready to deploy, use the `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push` commands to save and push your code to your GitHub repository.

3. Navigate to your GitHub repository in the browser and then select the Settings tab on the right side of the page.

4. On the Settings page, scroll down to the GitHub Pages section. Then, in the section labeled Source, select the `main` branch as your source.

5. Navigate to <your-github-username.github.io/your-repository-name> and you will find that your new webpage has gone live! For example, if your GitHub username is "lernantino" and the project is "css-demo-site", then your URL would be <lernantino.github.io/css-demo-site>.

You can also refer to this [YouTube video on enabling GitHub Pages](https://youtu.be/P4Mu1t5rIXg) for more guidance.

> **Important**: It might take a few minutes for GitHub pages to display your site correctly. If your project does not deploy or display correctly, check that all file paths in your application are relative and use the right casing. GitHub is case-sensitive, an inccorect capital or lowercase letter could cause problems in deployment.

Be sure to add, commit, and push your work to see the most up-to-date version of your app!

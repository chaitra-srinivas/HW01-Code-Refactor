# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

## About this project

In this assignment I have tried to refactor an existing code base. I have attempted to address the following issues to improve the quality of the code:
1. The webpage now has a descriptive title.
2. HTML has been updated to include semantic elements and conforms to accessibility standards.
3. The elements follow a logical structure.
4. CSS has been updated by grouping multiple selectors that apply the same style settings.
5. Added comments in HTML and CSS where appropriate.
6. Made sure all the links are working as they should.
7. The updated web application's appearance and functionality adhere to the design of the mock-up page.
